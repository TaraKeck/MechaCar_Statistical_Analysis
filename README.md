# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Deliverable 1:   
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Deliverable 2:
### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
(summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually)



## Deliverable 3:
### T-Tests on Suspension Coils
(summary of the t-test results across all manufacturing lots and for each lot)


## Deliverable 4:
### Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
